            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I am a junior studying computer science at Hunter college. I have an interest in programming, algorithms, and possibly areas like artificial intelligence, software engineering or data structures. Computer science major is a lot of fun!!! In my free time, I like watching documentaries that explore different cultures and ideas. My favorite show is Master Chef. I also enjoy crocheting. Hiking is another passion of mine.</p>
